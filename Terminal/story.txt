Three days ago, I woke from my two day long coma.
When I opened my eyes I could only see white.
Everything was so bright from the window.

-09:43 PM -2043 AD -Tuesday 28th November -:
Today, Alice visited me in the morning.
Apparently she was supposed to visit me on the 27th but her flight from Hawaii was delayed.
If I remember correctly, she went to Hawaii with her parents for winter break.

Today a nurse told me that I will be discharged in two days and I was served my first solid food in five days.
It was boiled chicken breast salad.
Bland but well cooked.

-04:37 PM -2043 AD -Saturday 2nd December -:
I was discharged this morning.
First thing I did was call my workplace and told my manager that I will be back to work by Monday.
Alice came to pick me up from the hospital and we went home.

-12:32 PM -2043 AD -Monday 4th December -:
When I went to work this morning, nothing has changed.
Hardly anyone has noticed my existence.
Aside from Carl and the security guard Lennie.
They are the only people who ever talks to me casually.

Today at work I overheard my team's tech support, Carl and his friend said something about a coffee shop.
"The coffee shop ---password ---it's ---underground."
At first I ignored it, but by lunch break I became irresistibly curious.
When I got home by two in the afternoon.
I turned on my computer and started snooping around the network at since Carl stays late for work quite frequently.
Like real late.
Five minutes into hacking Carl's workstation.
I monitored everything he typed for the last few hours.
Seems like nothing is here.
I cant find anything related to a coffee shop.
So then I had to send Carl a infected PDF manual/documentation for our project.
