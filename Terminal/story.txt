-11:53 PM -3003 AD -27th November -: Three days ago, I woke from my week long coma. When I opened my eyes I could only see white. Everything was so bright from the window. In the background I could hear my mother sobbing. Then I sat up on the hospital bed while a doctor walks in. She sat next to me. Her presence was so familiar, a light puff of perfume and a soft voice. Took me a while to realize, she is my girlfriend. I started to cry out of the blue. I have never felt this way before. My mother hugged me from the side, leaving her teardrops wet my gown. My girlfriend, Alice was crying from joy.

-08:11 PM -3003 AD 29th November -: Today Alice told me that I will be discharged in 3 days.

-09:37 AM -3003 AD -2nd December -: I was discharged yesterday morning.

-12:32 PM -3003 AD -3rd December -: When I left the hospital, I also left home. I moved in with Alice, we bought a condominium by the CorAI Research and Development Facility(That's where I work). Our room spanned across the entire floor of a condominium furnished with vintage lamps from the early 2000's. Lavish red and black couches by a fireplace. Bunch of bookcases filled with awards, trophies and books of course. At the center of the room there's a spiral stair that went above to the rooftop. Our walls are white grey and blue in thick stripes. Our bedroom had a ceiling-suspended bed and a wall mounted bar-counter. An ash wood closet door. The walls are concrete decorated by warm Christmas lights and several bar-stools.

-11:07 PM -3003 AD -4rth October -: Today I at work I overheard my team's debugger, Carl and his friend said something about a coffee shop. "The coffee shop ---password ---it's ---underground." At first I ignored it but by lunch break, I became irresistibly curious. When I got home by two in the afternoon. I turned on my computer and fired up my old friend AngelinaOS. A prototype hacker-AI running on a 4 terabyte rack server.
